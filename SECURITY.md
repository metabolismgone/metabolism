Hello, sorry to contact you using this feature but I've seen no other method.
I'm trying to contact you because of your github account,
I owned a company named Metabolism in France, and I've developed a lot of repository under this namespace ex : https://github.com/jerome-barbato/wordpress-bundle/blob/2.2.x/composer.json
It's complicated now that the plugin is used to change the namespace, I saw that your account is empty, would you mind renaming it so I can create an organization on github matching my projects name ?
my email : jerome.barbato{a}gmail.com
Thank you very much.
